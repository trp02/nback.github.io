### Game Description

#### Introduction
N-back is a renowned cognitive task, often utilized in psychological and cognitive experiments. Traditionally, it involves the display of characters, urging the player to remember and identify characters presented ‘n’ steps back in the sequence. Although an effective cognitive assessment tool, its bare-bones design often lacks the engagement and excitement sought by typical game players.

#### The Problem
The traditional N-back task, while valuable for cognitive research, may seem unengaging due to its lack of graphical attributes, goals, and varying difficulty levels. The monotony of characters and repetitive gameplay can diminish the user’s interest and engagement over time.

#### The Solution
Our team has identified and addressed these issues by incorporating engaging elements and varying difficulty levels to enhance the user experience. By transforming the characters into a diverse array of animal icons and integrating ascending difficulty levels, we've instilled a more game-like quality to captivate players' interest.

### Objective and Rules

#### Core Objective
Players aim to maximize correct responses while minimizing errors. They are challenged to recall and identify characters presented ‘n’ steps back in the sequence amidst increasing difficulty levels.

#### Gameplay Mechanics
Players are prompted with animal characters and must swiftly decide if the current character matches the one displayed ‘n’ steps earlier. The difficulty escalates by increasing the ‘n’ value or reducing response time, imposing greater cognitive load.

### Technology Stack

The game is built with:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

These technologies ensure compatibility, easy maintenance, and a broad base of developer knowledge.

### Setup and Deployment

The game is deployed using Ngrok. Follow these steps to set it up:

1. Download and install Ngrok from the official [website](https://ngrok.com/).
2. Initialize the N-Back game on your local server.
3. Run Ngrok, specifying the port number to create a secure tunnel to your localhost.
4. Share the generated public URL for remote access.

### Credits

We would like to extend our gratitude to:

- W3Schools, for the CSS code that enhanced our game’s visual appeal.
- Ngrok, for enabling a secure and efficient local server exposure.

### Reflection

Throughout the development process, we encountered several challenges, including optimizing the algorithm and establishing appropriate difficulty levels. By adjusting the algorithm and extensively testing gameplay mechanics, we achieved a balanced and engaging player experience.

The incorporation of animal characters and a moving window mechanism in the character roster were pivotal in ensuring diverse and engaging gameplay. The team's adaptability and collaborative problem-solving enabled us to transform the traditional N-back task into a captivating cognitive game.
